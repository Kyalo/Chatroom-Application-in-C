----------CLIENT-SERVER MODEL-----------
TCP - each request is a separate socket connection. A new socket is created for every request
UDP - client sends a request to server and awaits a response, then it continues executing

-- Server
Stores data in files
Handles most of the logic

-- Client
UI
For each action, it sends a request to the server and continues based on server response

All requests and responses are newline separated
